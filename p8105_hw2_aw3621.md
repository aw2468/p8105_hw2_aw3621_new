\##short paragraph about this dataset This dataset contain 1868
observations and have 32 varibales before data cleaning, after cleaning
there are 19 variables in total. To get this dataset, I standardize the
naming of the columns by using janitor::clean_names function; then
select the variable I want to keep; and use mutate function to covert
varibales from character to logical variable. This is not tidy because
there are 11 “route” variables in total right now.I was assuming these
variables may need to be merge as one route varibale. \### How many
distinct stations are there?

``` r

### What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
station_entrances = 
   nyc_transit_df |> 
      filter(vending == "NO", entry == TRUE)

exits_without_vending =
   nyc_transit_df |> 
   filter(vending == "NO")
 
proportion = nrow(station_entrances) / nrow(exits_without_vending)

proportion
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 0.3770 (or 37.70%).

For mr trash wheel:

             sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel',

```

For Professor Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r

                                    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",

For Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet:

             skip = 1, ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) 
```

Combine data:

``` r
trash_wheel<- trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(source = "Mr. Trash Wheel")

professor_trash_wheel<- professor_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(source = "Professor Trash Wheel")

gwynnda_trash_wheel <- gwynnda_trash_wheel %>% 
  mutate(source = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")

combined <- bind_rows(trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel, gwynnda_trash_wheel) %>% 
  relocate(source)
```

``` r
# Count the number of observations in the data set (with duplication)
num_observations <- nrow(combined)

num_observations
```

    ## [1] 1033

``` r
# Total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
combined %>% 
  filter(source == "Professor Trash Wheel") %>% 
  summarise(total_weight = sum(weight_tons, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(total_weight)
```

    ## [1] 246.74

``` r
# Total nuber of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in june 2022
combined %>% 
  filter(source == "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", month == "June", year == 2022) %>% 
  summarise(total_cig = sum(cigarette_butts, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(total_cig)
```

    ## [1] 18120

### From running the code above,we know that there are 1033 observations and 15 variables in total. There was 14 varibales orginally and the 1 new is what we created to identified which dataset is certain data from. This dataset is a combination of the Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnd Trash Wheel datasets.After doing calculation on R, we know that the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 246.74 tons. The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022 was 18120.

merge to create a single, final dataset:

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

final_data <- bakers %>%
  inner_join(bakes, by = c("baker", "series")) %>%
  inner_join(results, by = c("baker", "series", "episode")) %>%
  select(baker_last_name, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown,
         series, episode, signature_bake, show_stopper, technical, result)
write_csv(final_data, 
          "final_data.csv")
```

For this final dataset, I import all the dataset first,and then
standarized these three datasets. When I try to merge the data, one
problem I encountered was that it keep saying column `episode` doesn’t
exist. At first I thougth that was because I used “left_joined” function
instead of “inner_joined”, so I tried “left”/“right”/“inner” and realize
the problem may not be on this function. Thus, I have to use colnames
function to check what happen. However after checking, it does exist.
After checking millions of times I have to delere this code chunck to
redo it again. Luckily this time the code works. I am still not too sure
what happened to this R code, hopefully I can have chance to figure it
out when this semester end. The final dataset includes all the bakers
from the bakers dataset. It has their personal details, which series and
episode they were in, details about their bakes, and their results. The
data is organized starting with personal information like name, age,
job, and hometown. It then shows which series and episode they
participated in, details about their baking, and finally how they
performed.
